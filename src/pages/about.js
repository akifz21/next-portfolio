                        Hello there! My name is Mehmet Akif, and I'm a third-year computer engineering student with a passion for developing software applications. With extensive experience in Java, Spring boot, .NET, React, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Next.js, Node.js, and SQL, I have a strong foundation in full-stack development.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In addition to my technical skills, I have also learned essential concepts such as data structures, algorithms, database management and more in my academic studies. I'm excited to utilize these skills to develop scalable and efficient software solutions.
                    </p>
